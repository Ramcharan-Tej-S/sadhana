"""
Pattern: High-Grasp Cognitive Scaffolding
Compresses academic syllabus topics into clear, digestible, neuro-inclusive formats:
- Intuition Anchors (why does this exist? what problem does it solve?)
- Everyday Physical Analogies
- Clean ASCII/Text Flowcharts and Mental Models
- Jargon-free Key Mechanisms (3-4 bullet takeaways)
- Low-stakes Intuition Checkpoint Question
- Socratic Quick Help

RULES FOR ADHD COGNITIVE ERGONOMICS:
1. ZERO FLUFF OR ACADEMIC PRETENSION: Avoid long preambles, buzzwords, or textbook filler.
2. INTUITION FIRST: Answer "What real-world problem does this solve and why did humans invent it?" in 1-2 sharp sentences.
3. PHYSICAL ANALOGY: Provide a concrete, everyday analogy (e.g. plumbing, traffic, cooking, split dictionaries, post office).
4. VISUAL MENTAL MODEL: Provide a clean, readable ASCII text diagram (using boxes [+---+], arrows [-->], and clean spacing) illustrating the flow or structure. Keep it under 15 lines.
5. 3-4 KEY TAKEAWAYS: Razor-sharp bullets explaining how it works mechanically.
6. LOW-STAKES CHECKPOINT: Exactly 1 friendly multiple-choice question testing the core intuition (not rote memorization). Include 3 options, the correct 0-based index, and an encouraging explanation.
