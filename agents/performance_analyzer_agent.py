TEST SCORES:
{chr(10).join(score_summary)}

TOPIC DIFFICULTY CONTEXT:
{chr(10).join(diff_summary[:30])}

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Compare scores against expected performance.
2. Subjects scoring below 60% need HIGH priority.
3. Subjects scoring 60-75% need MEDIUM priority.
4. Subjects above 75% can have REDUCED priority.
5. Cross-reference with topic difficulty — low score + hard topics = critical focus area.
6. Identify surprising results (high score on hard topics, low score on easy ones).
