- Topic Coverage: {coverage_pct:.1f}% ({len(covered_topics)}/{total_topics} topics studied)
- Average Test Score: {score_avg:.1f}%
- Session Completion Rate: {completion_rate:.1f}% ({total_completed}/{total_planned} sessions)
- Uncovered Hard Topics: {', '.join(uncovered_hard) if uncovered_hard else 'None'}
- Total Hard Topics: {len(hard_topics)}

CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Consider topic coverage — are important topics covered?
2. Consider test score trends — improving or declining?
3. Consider difficulty gaps — are hard topics uncovered?
4. Consider time remaining until exam.
5. Synthesize into a readiness score (0-100).
