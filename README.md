## Quick start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env          # paste your OpenRouter key into it
python run.py                 # -> http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

On Windows, if `python` resolves to the `C:\Windows\System32\python` stub, use the launcher:

```powershell
py -3 run.py
```

The app works without an API key — you can add subjects, set exams, build the availability
grid, track routines, use the sensory audio engine, and test the thought parking lot. Only the
AI buttons need the key, and they provide helpful inline guidance when it's missing rather than
failing silently.

**First run, in order:** Setup → add subjects · Setup → upload a syllabus · Syllabus → run
the difficulty assessment · Schedule → set exam dates and availability · Optimizer →
generate the plan · Arena → launch your focus session with brown noise and the Thought Parking Lot.

Or hit **LOAD DEMO SAVE** on the landing page to seed subjects with topics, difficulty scores,
and initial data.

### Before a live demo

```bash
python prewarm.py     # parse every file in uploads/ into the cache
```

Uploads of those files then return in ~0.2s instead of 6–18s, and they won't fail during a
presentation due to a flaky network. `python prewarm.py --clear` empties the cache.

Two other things worth doing beforehand: narrow your **availability** windows (a 06:00–20:00
grid produces 11 sessions a day and a 50s plan generation; 3–4 hours a day is realistic and
much faster), and run the difficulty assessment once so the radar chart has data.

---

## Configuration

Everything lives in `.env` (gitignored). `config.py` loads it via `python-dotenv` before
anything reads `os.environ`.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | — | Required for the AI agents. Everything else works without it. |
| `EXAMFLOW_MODEL` | `openai/gpt-4o-mini` | Any OpenRouter model ID. Must support `response_format: json_object`. |
| `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` | Swap for a different OpenAI-compatible gateway. |
| `EXAMFLOW_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` | `16000` | Output ceiling for the schedule optimizer. |
| `EXAMFLOW_VISION` | `1` | Send images directly to the multimodal model. `0` forces offline RapidOCR. |
| `EXAMFLOW_CACHE` | `1` | Cache parsed documents by SHA-256 hash in `.cache/`. |
| `OPENROUTER_APP_NAME` / `OPENROUTER_SITE_URL` | `SADHANA` / localhost | Attribution headers shown on your OpenRouter dashboard. |
| `EXAMFLOW_HOST` / `EXAMFLOW_PORT` | `127.0.0.1` / `8000` | Server bind host and port. |
| `EXAMFLOW_OPEN` | `1` | Set `0` to prevent opening the browser automatically on launch. |

### Choosing a model

The agents emit deeply nested JSON, so the model must be reliable under
`response_format: json_object`. Verified options:

| Model | Prompt / Completion per 1M | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mistralai/mistral-small-3.2-24b-instruct` | $0.075 / $0.20 | Cheapest model that reliably maintains schema compliance. |
| `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct` | $0.10 / $0.32 | High reasoning accuracy on schedule constraints. |
| **`openai/gpt-4o-mini`** *(default)* | **$0.15 / $0.60** | Best reliability-to-cost ratio for the 3-pass judge and tutor. |
| `google/gemini-2.5-flash` | $0.30 / $2.50 | Strongest multimodal syllabus parsing. |

**Architectural separation:** `agents/` and `db/` contain pure Python logic independent of HTTP,
while the frontend communicates solely via clean JSON endpoints. `backend/main.py` serves as the
single integration bridge between the database, the agent orchestration layer, and the static UI.

---

## Request lifecycle

All agent-powered flows follow an orchestrated sequence. For example, during study plan optimization:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant P as pages/optimizer.js
    participant UI as ui.js withLoader
    participant API as POST /api/agent/generate-plan
    participant G as agent_call guard
    participant AG as schedule_optimizer_agent
    participant M as OpenRouter
    participant DB as SQLite

    U->>P: Click GENERATE OPTIMIZED PLAN
    P->>UI: withLoader("BUILDING YOUR RUN")
    UI-->>U: Full-screen retro loader
    UI->>API: fetch POST
    API->>DB: Fetch subjects, topics, difficulties, exams, availability, scores
    DB-->>API: Active rows
    API->>API: Verify preconditions (availability & exams set)
    API->>G: agent_call(generate_study_plan, ...)
    G->>AG: Invoke agent
    AG->>AG: Build allowed-slot grid from availability
    AG->>AG: Size max_tokens dynamically to slot count
    AG->>M: Send structured JSON prompt
    M-->>AG: Generated plan sessions
    AG->>AG: _validate_sessions drops slots outside allowed windows

        AG->>AG: Top up via _fallback_schedule
    end
    AG-->>G: Validated plan

    API->>DB: Replace existing sessions and persist plan
    API-->>UI: {saved, reasoning, strategy}
    UI-->>U: Dismiss loader, display toast, render reasoning
```

---

## The seven agents

Every agent lives in `agents/`, operates as a standalone function, and obtains its model via
`config.get_llm(temperature, max_tokens, json_mode)`.

| # | Agent | Pattern | LLM calls | Deterministic fallback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Syllabus Parser | Chain-of-thought extraction | 1 | Empty unit list with reasoning error |
| 2 | Difficulty Assessor | **LLM-as-Judge (3 passes)** | 3 | Pass-1 results, else fallback to `medium` @ 0.3 |
| 3 | Performance Analyzer | Comparative analysis | 1 | Threshold-based score arithmetic |
| 4 | Schedule Optimizer | Constraint-aware planning | 1 | Round-robin slot filler |
| 5 | Readiness Predictor | Chain-of-thought scoring | 1 per subject | Weighted formula with hard-topic penalties |
| 6 | Feedback Loop | Meta-analysis | 2 | Mean absolute error per subject |
| 7 | **ADHD Adaptive Tutor** | **High-grasp cognitive scaffolding** | 1 | Pre-formatted intuition anchor & ASCII mental model |

---

### 1. Syllabus Parser

`agents/syllabus_parser_agent.py` — transforms syllabi and past exam papers into structured units,
topics, and estimated revision durations.

- **Multimodal Vision:** Image uploads are routed directly to the multimodal model, preserving
  table formatting and reading complex text in 6–18s (compared to 40–90s via CPU-bound OCR).
- **Offline OCR Fallback:** RapidOCR executes locally when offline or when `EXAMFLOW_VISION=0`.
- **Content-Addressable Cache:** Documents are indexed by SHA-256 hash in `.cache/`. Re-uploaded files
  resolve in ~0.2s without making model requests.

---

### 2. Difficulty Assessor — LLM-as-Judge

`agents/difficulty_assessor_agent.py` — runs a multi-pass evaluation to mitigate central-tendency bias:

```mermaid
graph TB
    T["Subject topics<br/>ID · Name · Unit · Context"] --> P1

    subgraph Pass1["PASS 1 — Assess"]
        P1["Score 1.0-10.0 on:<br/>Abstraction · Math complexity<br/>Prerequisites · Typical friction"]
    end

    P1 --> A1["Initial assessments"]
    A1 --> P2

    subgraph Pass2["PASS 2 — Critique"]
        P2["Review ratings for:<br/>Central tendency bias<br/>Relative difficulty coherence<br/>Over/under-scoring"]
    end

    P2 --> A2["Critique & recommended deltas"]

    A1 --> P3
    A2 --> P3

    subgraph Pass3["PASS 3 — Calibrate"]
        P3["Synthesize consensus:<br/>Easy (1.0-3.5) · Medium (3.6-6.5) · Hard (6.6-10.0)<br/>Confidence (0.0-1.0) & reasoning"]
    end

    P3 --> R["Calibrated results"]
    R --> S["save_difficulty_results<br/>Defensive 4-stage topic matching"]
    S --> DB[("difficulty_scores")]
```

---

### 3. Performance Analyzer

`agents/performance_analyzer_agent.py` — translates real test performance (such as CIE scores) into
dynamically weighted study allocations:

- Banding: `<60%` (High Priority), `60–75%` (Medium Priority), `>75%` (Reduced Priority).
- Cross-referencing: Flags high-difficulty topics with poor scores as critical areas, and detects
  anomalies where students struggle with foundational topics.

---

### 4. Schedule Optimizer

`agents/schedule_optimizer_agent.py` — generates a comprehensive timetable enforcing nine strict constraints:

1. Adherence only to designated user availability windows.
2. Complete exclusion of days marked `NOT AVAILABLE`.
3. Standard 60-minute revision blocks separated by 15-minute cognitive breaks.
4. Placement of difficult topics during user-designated peak energy hours.
5. Spacing revisions across multiple days (spaced repetition).
6. Preserving a 2–3 day buffer prior to exams for final review.
7. Distributing subjects evenly within each study day.
8. Prioritizing subjects with upcoming exams or low continuous assessment scores.
9. Full utilization of free availability slots.

#### Dynamic Recalculation (`recalculate_after_skip`)

When sessions are marked skipped, recalculation preserves completed milestones and rebooks
only the missed topics into future open slots, verified against current availability windows.

---

### 5. Readiness Predictor

`agents/readiness_predictor_agent.py` — evaluates exam preparedness per subject based on:

- Topic coverage percentage (verified against completed sessions).
- Weighted score trends across past tests.
- Session completion rates.
- Uncovered difficult topics.
- Days remaining until the scheduled exam date.

---

### 6. Feedback Loop

`agents/feedback_loop_agent.py` — evaluates the accuracy of the platform's own predictions:

- Computes signed errors between predicted readiness and actual exam outcomes.
- Detects systematic bias (over-confidence vs. under-confidence).
- Generates actionable habit adjustments categorized by time management, study technique, and focus.

---

### 7. ADHD Adaptive Tutor

`agents/adaptive_tutor_agent.py` — designed specifically for neurodivergent learning patterns and cognitive clarity:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Input["Topic + Student Class Notes"] --> Prompt["ADHD Cognitive Ergonomics Engine"]
    Prompt --> A["1. Intuition Anchor<br/>Why does this concept exist in 1-2 sharp sentences?"]
    Prompt --> B["2. Everyday Physical Analogy<br/>Metaphor using plumbing, traffic, or real-world systems"]
    Prompt --> C["3. ASCII Visual Mental Model<br/>Clean box-and-arrow diagrams (under 15 lines)"]
    Prompt --> D["4. Key Mechanisms<br/>3-4 razor-sharp takeaways with zero academic fluff"]
    Prompt --> E["5. Low-Stakes Checkpoint<br/>1 friendly multiple-choice question testing intuition"]

    A --> Out["High-Retention Study Scroll"]
    B --> Out
    C --> Out
    D --> Out
    E --> Out
```

- **Material Compression (`/api/tutor/compress`):** Condenses dense textbook chapters and uploaded
  handwritten notes into an intuitive study scroll.
- **Grounding in Student Notes:** Extracts context from student-uploaded class notes (`study_notes` table)
  so explanations reuse the specific terminology taught in lectures.
- **Socratic Quick Helper (`/api/tutor/ask`):** Provides instant, supportive answers capped at 70 words
  during active focus sessions to unblock stuck students without derailing concentration.

---

## ADHD & Neurodivergent Focus Suite

SADHANA includes dedicated tools designed for executive function support, hyperfocus management, and energy fluctuations:

### Thought Parking Lot
- **Location:** Accessible globally from the navigation bar (`parkingLot.js`).
- **Function:** When intrusive thoughts or tangential tasks arise during a study session, students can
  quickly park them without opening separate apps.
- **Persistence:** Stored in browser `localStorage`, with unread badge indicators and instant clearing once addressed.

### Focus Shield & Distraction Blocker
- **Location:** Focus Arena & Settings (`distractionBlocker.js`).
- **Function:** Manages distraction-blocking preferences across 12+ common social and entertainment platforms
  (Instagram, YouTube, Discord, Reddit, TikTok).
- **Platform Integration:** Prompts Android Focus Mode triggers on mobile browsers and provides active visual
  warning shields during study intervals on desktop.

### Sensory Audio Engine
- **Location:** Focus Arena (`audio.js`).
- **Function:** Real-time ambient sound generation using the native **Web Audio API** (zero external sound files or streaming bandwidth required).
- **Audio Modes:**
  - **Brown Noise:** Deep, rumbling low-frequency noise optimized for masking distractions and sustaining attention.
  - **Rain Texture:** Soft pink/white noise filtered to simulate natural rainfall.
  - **Binaural Pulse:** 40 Hz gamma beat frequency to encourage cognitive focus.
- **Persistence:** Selected mode and volume levels persist across reloads.

### Low-Energy Day Dynamic Adaptation
- **Location:** Today's Routine (`/api/routine/energy` & `/api/routine/adapt`).
- **Function:** Students can toggle **Low Energy Mode** on difficult days.
- **Behavior:** The optimizer dynamically reduces session volume, postpones high-difficulty topics,
  and spreads workloads across subsequent days to maintain momentum without burnout.

## Frontend architecture

The frontend is built with pure ES modules, CSS variables, and HTML5 canvas/SVG. It requires
no React, Vite, Webpack, or npm dependencies.

### Design System: 8-Bit Arcade
- **Typography:** `Press Start 2P` for arcade headings and badges; `VT323` at 21px for body copy.
- **Palette:** Classic arcade palette (`--paper: #FDF6E3`, `--ink: #1A1A2E`, `--blue: #2A6FDB`, `--red: #E63946`, `--yellow: #FFC94A`, `--green: #3FA34D`).
- **Icons & Sprites:** Procedurally compiled SVG rects generated via character grids in `sprites.js` with zero image asset overhead.
- **Charts:** Lightweight, crisp SVG visualizers in `ui.js` (radar chart, bar charts, step-line charts, stat meters).

## Extending it

### Adding a new agent
1. Create `agents/my_agent.py` as a function accepting inputs and returning a dictionary.
2. Initialize models with `get_llm(temperature=..., max_tokens=..., json_mode=True)` and include a deterministic fallback.
3. Expose the agent in `backend/main.py` wrapped inside `agent_call(...)` for automatic 502 error handling.
4. Bind the endpoint in `frontend/js/api.js` and call it using `withLoader(...)` in the UI.

### Adding a sprite
Add a 2D string array to the `SPRITES` object in `frontend/js/sprites.js` using palette character mappings,
then invoke it anywhere via `sprite('mysprite', 32)`.

## Performance and cost

Benchmarks using the default `openai/gpt-4o-mini` on a curriculum of 6 subjects and 115 topics:

| Action | Latency | Estimated cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Parse text syllabus (PDF/TXT) | 5–15s | < $0.01 |
| Parse image syllabus (Vision) | 6–18s | < $0.01 |
| **Any cached document hit** | **0.1–0.4s** | **$0.00 (Free)** |
| 3-Pass difficulty assessment (11 topics) | ~30s | ~$0.01 |
| Performance analysis | ~8s | < $0.01 |
| **Generate complete plan (200+ sessions)**| **~45s** | **~$0.01** |
| Dynamic recalculation | ~20s | < $0.01 |
| Adaptive Tutor compression | ~4–8s | < $0.01 |
| Sensory Audio Engine (Brown Noise/Rain) | **Instant** | **$0.00 (Runs 100% in browser)** |

## Troubleshooting

- **`OPENROUTER_API_KEY is not set`**: Create a `.env` file in the project root containing `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key` and restart `python run.py`.
- **Windows launcher conflicts**: If `python` opens the Windows Store, execute using `py -3 run.py` instead.
- **Audio engine produces no sound**: Web browsers require user interaction before playing audio. Click anywhere inside the Focus Arena to initialize the Web Audio context.
- **Offline OCR installation**: For offline environments without vision API access, run `pip install rapidocr-onnxruntime`.
- **Clearing the parse cache**: Run `python prewarm.py --clear` to purge cached document hashes from `.cache/`.
- **Browser caching during local development**: Use `Ctrl + F5` or `Ctrl + Shift + R` to hard-refresh unbundled JavaScript modules.

## Known limitations

- **Single-User Architecture:** Designed for local self-hosted execution via SQLite; multi-tenant authentication is not configured by default.
- **Local Network Exposure:** Uploaded file names and payloads are validated for local desktop use; add rigorous file-type sanitization before exposing port 8000 to public networks.
- **Plan Generation Scope:** Re-generating the schedule creates a fresh optimization run. To preserve completed session history, use the **Recalculate** or **Low Energy Adapt** features.
